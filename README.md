# Privacy Policy for POVGuitar

POVGuitar values your privacy. This app is designed to help guitarists visualize and customize scale patterns across the fretboard while keeping your personal information secure and private.

## Information Collection and Use
POVGuitar does **not** collect, store, or share any personal information for analytics, advertising, or marketing purposes.  
All scale data, color choices, and customization settings are stored **locally on your device** and are never transmitted to external servers.

If you choose to use optional features that connect to AI services (for example, in-app chat or visualization suggestions), your messages may be securely sent to an AI service provider—such as Google Vertex AI or OpenAI—for processing. These messages are used only to generate a response and are **not stored, sold, or used for advertising**. POVGuitar itself does not retain or analyze these messages.

## Subscriptions and Payments
If you purchase a premium upgrade or subscription, all payment processing is handled securely through Apple’s App Store.  
POVGuitar does not collect or store any payment or billing information.

## Support and Contact
If you contact the developer for support, any information you voluntarily provide (such as your name, email address, or device details) will only be used to assist with your inquiry and will never be shared or sold.

## Third-Party Services
POVGuitar may rely on trusted third-party frameworks (such as Apple StoreKit or AI service APIs) to provide functionality.  
Each of these services follows its own privacy policy and complies with Apple’s developer and data protection guidelines.

## Your Consent
By using POVGuitar, you consent to this Privacy Policy and acknowledge that optional AI interactions are processed only to generate educational or visual responses.
